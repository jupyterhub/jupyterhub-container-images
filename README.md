# JupyterHub Container Images

[![Build](https://github.com/manics/jupyterhub-container-images/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/manics/jupyterhub-container-images/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Definitions and workflows for publishing JupyterHub container images.

## How this works

All pushes to `main` (and any designated backport branches) are built and published.
Pushes to `main` are assumed to always be the latest, so images are always tagged with

- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILDNUMBER`
- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- `MAJOR.MINOR`
- `MAJOR`
- `latest`

where `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` is the JupyterHub version.

## Publishing backports

Backports are published in their own branches.
